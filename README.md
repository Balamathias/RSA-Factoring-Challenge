# RSA!

## RSA - A python-based cryptography experiment

RSA is an encryption or a decryption based process where public and private secret keys play a role

The public secret is used for encryption but not decryption as it can be used by just anyone

The private key on the other hand is only known to the owner and is majorly used for decryption

Quite a number of math formulas supports RSA.

It revolves around the multiplication of two very large prime numbers.

Interestingly, the power of RSA lies in the difficulty posed by the computation of the factors of very large numbers as it is not a child's play.
